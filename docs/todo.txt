MISC JS
1. figure out how to reduce reduntant import statements or how that even works
2. why couldnt file reader read a relative file ref?
3. .env 
    - simpler syntax possible? 
    - why is env vals for pool.js not working 

API
1. error handleing for DB and API
    - get: either send data or error code

SQL
1. It seems as if most statements in a CRUD structure follow a pattern
    could probably be abstracted in some way
2. What buisness logic should be delegated to backend code vs. sql schema?
    - My findings:
    - Influences for putting in sql:
        - has to do with nature of the DATA itself
        - agnostic to the backend that is being used
            - rebutal: at some point modularity has to end somewhere
        - SQL code can more effiecient than js, especially in cases that it is
            well suited for
    - Influences for putting in node:
        - js code is easier to write and maintain by myself and others
        - reduce the ammount of languages being used in the app
        - there are many things that can't be expressed well in SQL

REACT
double excecution as evident as output duplicated in the console
